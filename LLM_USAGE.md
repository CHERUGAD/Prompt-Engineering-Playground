## Local LLM Usage

We use Ollama to run local LLMs such as `mistral` for inference without relying on cloud APIs.

### Model Used:
- **mistral**: Lightweight transformer-based LLM loaded locally via Ollama.

### Inference Flow:
1. Prompt is defined inside each script (e.g., `zero_shot.py`)
2. `run_prompt()` function (from `scripts/run_prompt.py`) sends the prompt to Ollama.
3. Ollama runs the `mistral` model locally and returns the response.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Inference (Zero-Shot)
ðŸ”¹ Zero-Shot Prompt:
My name is Ravikiran

ðŸ§  LLM Response:
Hello Ravikiran! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today? If you have any questions or need help with something, feel free to ask. I am here to help!


## ðŸ§ª Sample Inference (Few-Shot)

**Prompt:**
Classify the sentiment of the following sentences as Positive or Negative:

I absolutely loved the new Batman movie. -> Positive

The weather today is terrible and ruined my plans. -> Negative

This laptop works incredibly fast and looks sleek. -> Positive

ðŸ”¹ Chain-of-Thought Prompt:
Let's solve this step by step:
Question: If you have 3 apples and you eat one, how many do you have left?
Step 1: Start with 3 apples.
Step 2: Eat 1 apple.
Step 3: You are left with ->

ðŸ§  LLM Response:
3 - 1 = 2 apples. So, if you started with 3 apples and ate one, you will be left with 2 apples.

ðŸ”¹ Reflection Prompt:
Why did the chicken cross the road?

Answer: To get to the other side.

Now reflect on whether this answer is logically sound and complete. Suggest how it could be improved if necessary.

ðŸ§  LLM Response:
The answer "To get to the other side" is both logically sound and complete in the context of a classic joke or riddle about a chicken crossing a road. However, if we consider a more detailed or imaginative response for creative writing, the answer could be:

"The chicken crossed the road because it had heard rumors of fresh cornfields on the other side, where it could forage without competition from larger animals. With a confident strut and a glint in its eye, it took each step with determination, driven by the promise of a bountiful harvest."

This answer expands upon the original response by providing reasoning behind the chicken's actions, adding depth to the story, and creating a more engaging narrative.

ðŸ”¹ Role Prompting:
You are a physics professor. Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms to a 10-year-old student.   

ðŸ§  LLM Response:
Alright, let's imagine you're on a superfast spaceship traveling near the speed of light. Now, here on Earth, things seem normal because we're not moving that fast compared to our surroundings. But when you're traveling so quickly, some strange things happen!

Firstly, let me tell you about Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. It says that space and time are connected into a single thing called spacetime, and it can bend or curve around massive objects like planets or stars. This is what we call gravity. But here's the cool part - if you travel really fast, spacetime gets stretched out in front of you! That means time slows down for you compared to us here on Earth.       

For example, if you were able to travel at 99% of the speed of light and stayed away for a year, when you returned, we would have aged much more than you because time passed faster for us. You'd be like, "Wow! I've only been gone for a year, but it seems like so much longer here!" That's one of the weird things about relativity.

Now, there's also General Theory of Relativity, which deals with gravity and larger objects like planets or stars. It says that as an object gets more massive, it creates stronger gravitational pull, and its spacetime gets warped even more. This means that planets move in elliptical (not circular) paths around the sun because of the Sun's mass causing spacetime to curve!

So, in simple terms, Einstein's theories tell us that space and time are linked together, massive objects can bend them, and if you travel very fast or very close to a massive object, things start acting differently than what we experience here on Earth. It helps scientists understand the universe better and even make predictions about black holes! Isn't that fascinating?


ðŸ”¹ Tool Use Prompt:
You are a helpful assistant. You have access to a calculator.
User: What is the square root of 144?
Assistant: Let's use the calculator to compute sqrt(144). The answer is 12.

ðŸ§  LLM Response:
The square root of 144 is 12.
